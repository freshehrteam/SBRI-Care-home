IoRN2 is a standardised questionnaire and algorithm tool that groups people according to the degree of their functional independence, summarising the key characteristics of people who use health and care services. The ioRN2 tool is available for people who live in the community (e.g. at their own home), while a different version (Augmented ioRN) is also available for people living in care homes or who are in hospital.">
