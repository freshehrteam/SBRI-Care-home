Augmented ioRN is a standardised questionnaire and algorithm tool that groups people according to the degree of their functional independence, summarising the key characteristics of people who use health and care services. The Augmented ioRN tool is available for people who live in care homes or who are in hospital, while a different version (ioRN2) is also available for people living in the community (e.g. at their own home).">
